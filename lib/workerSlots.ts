/**
 * LEGACY — coordinator session-retry path only.
 *
 * Returns true for agents with the legacy `orc-N` naming format. These were
 * previously synthesised by `reconcileManagedWorkerSlots` (now removed) and
 * received automatic session-start retries. New ephemeral workers use random
 * orc-themed two-word names (e.g. `broken-nose`, `slithering-arrow`) and
 * return false here, which causes the coordinator to fail-and-requeue on
 * session start failures — the correct behaviour for externally-launched
 * ephemeral workers.
 *
 * TODO: remove this file once the coordinator's isManagedSlot call-sites are
 * updated to reflect the unified ephemeral-worker lifecycle.
